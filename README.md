# Python Recipe Recommender & Predictive Model

## üìñ Project Overview

This is an end-to-end data science project that demonstrates a full data pipeline, from data acquisition and feature engineering to model development and evaluation. The project's core objectives were to build a content-based recipe recommender system and a predictive model to classify recipe "tastiness."

The project showcases skills in web scraping, data pre-processing, natural language processing techniques for feature extraction, and the implementation and evaluation of machine learning models.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Breakdown

### 1. Data Acquisition (Web Scraping)
* Developed a Python script using **BeautifulSoup** to scrape recipe data from a dynamic website.
* The scraped data, including recipe titles, ratings, and ingredients, was parsed and structured into a Pandas DataFrame.
* The final clean dataset was exported to a `.csv` file for use in the modelling stages.

### 2. Content-Based Recommender Engine
* Engineered a `combine_features` column by concatenating key textual features (`title`, `category`, `ingredients`, etc.) to create a "document" for each recipe.
* Utilised **`CountVectorizer`** from Scikit-learn to convert these text documents into a matrix of token counts.
* Computed a **cosine similarity matrix** to determine the similarity between all pairs of recipes based on their content.
* Implemented two distinct recommendation functions:
    * **Vector Space Method:** Returns the top 10 most similar recipes for a given input recipe using matrix-vector multiplication.
    * **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Implemented the KNN algorithm to find the 10 most similar recipes, offering an alternative approach to similarity calculation.

### 3. Predictive Model for Recipe "Tastiness"
* Developed a binary classification model to predict whether a recipe would be rated as "tasty" based on its features.
* The model was trained and tested on the dataset, and its performance was evaluated to determine its predictive accuracy.
